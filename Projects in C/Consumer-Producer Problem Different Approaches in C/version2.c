/*We made the consumers more aggressive/active,
 so producers do not have enough time to fill in the buffer fully:
 producer function is much slower than consumer fucntion because of sleep(), also
 consumer threads are created before the producer threads as well as
we limited the number of actions per thread and equaled it to the size of the buffer*/
